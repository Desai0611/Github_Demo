  <p class="box"> India is a land with a vast variety of wildlife and a large variety of cultures. Situated in South Asia’s heartland, India is a densely populated country. It is a vastly diverse country in terms of culture, climate, religion, and language. India has chosen a number of emblems to represent our country’s image. Saffron, white, and green make up the Indian national flag. The Ashok chakra in the centre has a navy blue 24-spoke wheel that represents virtue.<br><br>

India is well-known for possessing the world’s greatest cultural diversity. Even for Indians, visiting and exploring every culture in India is quite difficult. India’s various cultures attract visitors from all over the world who want to come here at least once in their lives to experience India’s rich diversity.<br><br>

India is a secular and democratic country that gives the liberty to practise any religion. Along with that, every individual in India has the liberty to read any religious book of their choice. Every individual has the liberty to move to any part of the country and adapt to the culture of that region. Every state of India has its own official language.<br><br>

Jana Gana Mana is our national anthem, while Vande Matram is our national song. In the ‘Lion Capital of Asoka’, India’s national emblem, four lions sit back to back on a cylindrical base with four Ashok chakras on each side, only one of which is visible in the front. There are three lions visible and one concealed. It is a sign of sovereignty that also represents strength and bravery. It is a beautiful country that excels in art, culture, architecture, education, etc.<br><br>
